# SchemaEvolution

SchemaEvolution is a schema migration library that focuses on facilitating the evolution of schemas over time. It provides a set of tools and utilities to manage and transition between different versions of schemas within JavaScript applications.

With SchemaEvolution, you can define schema objects that represent different versions or stages of your data structure. Each schema object includes a version identifier and a parse function that converts incoming data to the corresponding schema version.

The library allows you to create update paths that define the transitions between different schema versions. An update path consists of a source schema, a target schema, and an update function that transforms data from the source schema to the target schema.

Using these update paths, SchemaEvolution enables you to convert data from one schema version to another. It automatically determines the shortest path between two schema versions, considering the available update paths, and applies the necessary transformations to migrate the data.

SchemaEvolution provides flexibility and extensibility, allowing you to define and manage complex schema evolution scenarios. It helps ensure data compatibility and consistency when evolving your application's data structures over time.

By leveraging SchemaEvolution, you can handle schema changes, data migrations, and backward compatibility in a structured and manageable way, making it easier to adapt and evolve your application as requirements evolve.
